- Here is the demo: http://themouette.github.io/jquery-week-calendar/weekcalendar_demo_3.html

- Subtask #1

Please, add a new section with date picker which allows managing date view on the calendar (similar to this one - http://prntscr.com/kyfsnr)

- Subtask #2

To change Event view style: We have to see the title first and time after - http://prntscr.com/kyftsj

- Subtask #3

New feature: We can see the transparent section ‘Event’ in the previous place while moving the event until it is selected in a new location - similar to the Google calendar. The time is changing during moving dynamically, depends on 'Event' card position.
